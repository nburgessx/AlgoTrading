    "- We have followed the [**modular programming**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming) approach here. To wit: We break a large task into smaller tasks (i.e. functions) to increase readability and make it easier to incorporate changes or detect errors. \n",
    "- Any model we build is only as good as its assumptions. So carefully observe what implicit AND explicit assumptions you're making.\n",
    "- **Ignoring market friction:** We have not taken into account transaction costs, slippage, taxes, etc. Remember that whatever results we get are a highly optimistic presentation of what would actually result.\n",
    "- **Look-ahead bias:** We decide on the trade based on Monday's close price. Then, we trade at that price itself. This is perfectly fine when we are hitting our straps with programming and backtesting. However, in real life, you would have to trade at a price AFTER the close. We have implicitly assumed that we can get a trade at the close price. As we sharpen our strategy before launching it in live markets, we should factor this in and make suitable modifications.\n",
    "- The code and approach that we follow here is specifically for working with historical data. It CANNOT be directly deployed in the live markets. Changes would need to be made. That's a subject for a different day. But you should be cognizant of this.\n",
