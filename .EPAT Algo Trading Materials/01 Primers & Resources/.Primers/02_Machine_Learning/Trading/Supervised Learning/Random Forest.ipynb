    "# Random Forest\n",
    "Random Forest, also called Random Decision Forests, is a method in machine learning capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It is a type of ensemble learning that uses multiple learning algorithms for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest comprises of decision trees, which are graphs of decisions representing their course of action or statistical probability. These multiple trees are plotted to a single tree called the Classification and Regression (CART) Model. To classify an object based on its attributes, each tree gives a classification that is said to vote for that class. The forest then chooses the classification with the maximum number of votes. For regression, it considers the average of the outputs for different trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Working</b>\n",
    "1. It assumes the number of cases as N. Then, randomly but with replacement, the sample of these N cases is taken out, which will be the training set.\n",
    "2. Considering M to be the input variables, a number m is selected such that m < M. The best split between m and M is used to split the node. The value of m is held constant as the trees are grown.\n",
    "3. Each tree is grown as large as possible.\n",
    "4. By aggregating the predictions of n trees (i.e., majority votes for classification, the average for\n",
    "regression), random forest predicts the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest has certain advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantages</b>\n",
    "1. This method balances the errors which are present in the dataset.\n",
    "2. It is an effective method because it maintains accuracy even if it has to estimate the missing data.\n",
    "3. Using the out-of-bag error estimate removes the need for a set-aside test set.\n",
    "4. Random Forest helps in unsupervised clustering, data views, and outliner detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disadvantages</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of the random forest may include its inability to be at par excellence for the regression problem as it does not give precise continuous nature predictions. It cannot predict beyond the range in the\n",
    "training data. Further, it does not provide complete control to the modeller.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about <a href=\"https://blog.quantinsti.com/random-forest-algorithm-in-python/\"> Random Forest</a> and their application in trading in this article. \n",
